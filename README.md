## Idea
Vocabulize is an app that uses physical interaction and visual representation improve learning of vocabulary words.

An app that gives you a stack of vocabulary cards with words and their definitions, and has you draw a visual representation of that vocabulary word, and then makes you a quiz from the cards you made.

Quiz levels can be easy or hard. Hard mode gives the user the word and has them pick the correct definition from multiple choice options. Easy mode gives them the word and the picture.

## APIs
We plan to use the Random-Words-API [Random-Words-API](https://github.com/mcnaveen/Random-Words-API) and possibly the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-collegiate-dictionary).

## Libraries
The main library we plan to use is the [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) library for creating the images for the cards. We also plan to use front end libraries for UI/UX implementation.

## Roadmap
Currently this is a front-end only app. But in the future we are considering adding a back end and allowing users to have profiles and save cards so that they can be reviewed later.
